## I Have A Question

## Reporting Bugs
When reporting bugs we ask that you use the github issue tracker. We have created a web form template requiring the following information: 
1. Description of bug
   - Describe the bug to the best of your ability by including your development environment, working branches, and any necessary details regarding the bug.
2. Expectations and Results
   - Describe what you expected to occur and what resulted instead. An easy format for this is `"I expected _ to occur when _ , but it instead resulted in _"`. This allows Trivial developers to easily grasp your expectations and identify whether the bug should or should not meet your expectations.
3. Reproducible Steps
   - Provide steps for Trivial developers to follow in order to confirm your issue. Once an issue has been reviewed, Trivial developers will either add comments for clarification or label the issue as `approved`.

## Code Contributions
We are glad to hear you want to contribute even further. Here are some guidelines to follow before creating your awesome code contributions through pull requests. 

### How to find available code contributions
We encourage contributing developers to view the issue tracker for available issues. Please confirm that there is an `available` label on the issue. Once you find an available issue you'd like to work on, please place a comment under the issue stating that you'll be undertaking the issue and change the label to `work-in-progress`. In addition, link your branch or pull request using the "Development" side tab on issue. If a developer undertakes an issue, but has no progress/commits within two weeks then the issue will be made `available`.

### Before creating a pull request
To initiate a pull request, ensure that you have claimed an available issue or feature request and received verification/approval from a Trivial developer. If you haven't done so yet, please assign yourself an issue or feature request that has been labeled `approved`. 

### Pull Request Process



### Security Issues Notification

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker in github, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [security@withtrivial.com](security@withtrivial.com).
